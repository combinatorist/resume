- Attended 2 Big Data conferences and collaborated to design and run our team’s first Hadoop project (AWS EMR)
- Maintained technical relationships w/ other companies (HowStuffWorks, eContext / Zenya) in acquiring process
- Designed and oversaw tests of eContext’s Keyword and Content Classifiers & gave 2 hr. presentation to President
- Frequently read source code and documentation, discussed algorithm improvements with leads, and wrote specs

## Intern Big Data Analyst
(Infospace/Blucora: August 2013 – December 2013)
- Conducted a pilot study of SNA/graph clustering techniques on our keyword library (Gephi)
- Won “Blaze” award for finding a year-old bug in our UX A/B testing platform
- Built, tested, and maintained ETL process to give the company actionable device revenue data (XL, SQL)
- Used R and Python to run clustering algorithms and perform standard and customized statistical calculations
- Wrote complex SQL queries to our on-premise IBM Netezza Machine and the cloud (AWS Redshift)

# Volunteer Experience
## Community Outreach & Diversity Lead
(Code for Nashville: June 2018-Present)
- Helping define the organization's future as well as this new role
- Serving to make sure our community of civic hackers is "open", not just technically but also socially
- Negotiating and defining new projects with outside community partners
- Mentoring and advising volunteer project leads on technical direction and team management

## Coder / Collaborator
(Code for Nashville: January 2017-May 2018)
- Volunteered at the Code for Nashville chapter of the Code for America Brigade
- Helped us move our apps to a serverless architecture with Terraform on AWS to reduce maintenance and cost

## Court Appointed Special Advocate
(CASA of Nashville: October 2015-Present)

- CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) gets high-risk neglect / abuse cases triaged from juvenile court.
- Then, the organization (usually county level) matches 1 volunteer to each case / family.
- The court gives the volunteer access to all records for the child to mentor, monitor, and support them.
- The court solicits our official recommendation about the child's best interest for a permanent placement.
- Our presence often leads to greater accountability over the many fragmented organizations that serve the family.

## Various Math & Science Tutoring Roles
(Seattle: January 2008 - April 2015)
